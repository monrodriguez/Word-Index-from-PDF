Word Index from PDF

This script helps creating an automated index for the keywords at the end of a book.
It is also useful to search and find the page in which words are within a pdf text. 

**  CAREFUL ** There might be some change in the page numbers if the pdf has its own numeration. 
The difference is added on the dataframe before aggregating the values.
