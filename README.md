Word Index from PDF

This script helps creating an automated index for the keywords at the end of a book.
It is also useful to search and find the page in which words are within a pdf text. 

**  CAREFUL ** There might be some change in the page numbers if the pdf has its own numeration. 
The difference is added on the dataframe before aggregating the values.  
Also, check keywords that might be in the bibliography or in the prologue. 
  * The pages of prologue or the pages of bibliography can be introduced manually and then the script cleans them.
